An AR-based product visualizer that lets users view, explore, and interact with real-scale 3D products in their real environment using mobile or any android devices.

AR Product Visualizer – Project Overview

This AR Product Visualizer is a Unity-based augmented reality application designed to showcase 3D products in an interactive and engaging way. Using image-based tracking, the app allows users to scan a physical marker or product surface to instantly place a realistic 3D model in the real world.
Users can interact with the product through touch or controller-based inputs to rotate, scale, and explore different parts. Individual components of the model support hover or tap interactions, displaying contextual information such as part names or descriptions. The application focuses on smooth performance, accurate model placement, and intuitive interactions, making it suitable for exhibitions, demos, and marketing use cases.
The project emphasizes clean AR interactions, modular Unity scripts, and reusable components, making it easy to extend with additional products or interaction logic in the future.
